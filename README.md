# Project Title: NFT Raffle System

## Project Description
An on-chain raffle system where participants can buy tickets using ETH to win an NFT. A fair and verifiable winner is selected randomly after the raffle ends.

## Key Features

- Only the contract owner can trigger raffle ending.
- Uses secure randomness from on-chain values (timestamp + prevrandao).
- NFT is transferred to the randomly chosen winner.
- Owner can withdraw funds after raffle ends.

## Future Scope
- Chainlink VRF integration for provable randomness.
- Multiple raffles or batch raffles.
- Frontend dApp interface for minting/buying/viewing.
- ERC20 ticketing instead of ETH.
